# Tech Stack

Every dependency in `package.json`, what it does, and why it is here.
Package name: `next16-claude-starter` · version `0.1.0` · private.

## Core framework

| Package | Version | Role |
|---------|---------|------|
| `next` | `16.2.0` | App Router framework. ⚠️ See warning below. |
| `react` / `react-dom` | `19.2.4` | UI runtime |
| `typescript` | `^5` | Type system — `any` is banned |

> [!warning] This is not the Next.js you may know
> `AGENTS.md` warns: APIs, conventions, and file structure may differ from older
> Next.js knowledge. Always check [[routing]] before writing routing code, and
> heed deprecation notices.

## Styling

| Package | Version | Role |
|---------|---------|------|
| `tailwindcss` | `^4` | Utility CSS — **no `tailwind.config.js`** |
| `@tailwindcss/postcss` | `^4` | PostCSS integration |

Tailwind v4 is configured entirely in `src/app/globals.css` via `@theme inline`.
See [[design-system]].

## Animation (the heart of the starter)

| Package | Version | Role |
|---------|---------|------|
| `@react-spring/web` | `^10.0.3` | Spring physics — drives **all** motion |
| `spring-text-engine` | `^0.1.5` | Scroll-aware spring text animation |

No `framer-motion`, no CSS transitions/keyframes. See [[animation-system]] and
[[text-engine]]. ADR: [[decisions-log]] ADR-0002.

## Scroll & state

| Package | Version | Role |
|---------|---------|------|
| `lenis` | `^1.3.19` | Smooth scrolling |
| `zustand` | `^5.0.12` | Lightweight global state (scroll store) |
| `resize-observer-polyfill` | `^1.5.1` | ResizeObserver fallback for animation hooks |
| `zod` | `^4.4.3` | Schema validation — env (`src/env.ts`) + API payloads. See [[api-architecture]] |

See [[smooth-scroll]] and [[data-flow]].

## Misc

| Package | Version | Why |
|---------|---------|-----|
| `lucide-react` | `^1.31.0` | Icon set for the showcase band. Tree-shakes per import, so only the icons actually used ship. |

Everything else is in-house. Cookie consent is our own component
(`src/components/common/Cookie/`) built on Zustand + `@react-spring/web` — the
former `react-cookie-consent` package was removed. See [[components/common]].

> [!note] Two icon approaches coexist, on purpose
> `views/home/card-icon.tsx` hand-rolls its SVGs because those glyphs are
> bespoke to the platform bento. The showcase band uses Lucide because it needs
> a dozen generic developer-tooling marks that are not worth drawing. Reach for
> `card-icon` when the glyph carries meaning, Lucide when it is texture.

## Tooling

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| `eslint` `^9` + `eslint-config-next` | Linting — run `yarn lint` before commits |
| `@types/*` | Type definitions for node/react |

## Scripts

```bash
yarn dev      # next dev — local development
yarn build    # next build — production build
yarn start    # next start — serve production build
yarn lint     # eslint
```

Package manager: **Yarn** (`yarn.lock` is committed).

## Not yet in the stack

Auth, database/ORM, payments, i18n, data-fetching libraries. The original starter
spec listed these as "add as needed" placeholders. Document them here when adopted,
and add an ADR to [[decisions-log]].
